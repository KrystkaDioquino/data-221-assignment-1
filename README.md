# DATA 221: Assignment 1 Descriptions

Question 1: Controlled Multiplication Loop
This program asks the usser to input the threshold value and multiplies consecutive numbers starting from 1 until the product is greater than or equal to the threshold.

Question 2: Nested Dictionary from Strings
This program takes in a list of strings and creates a dictionary where each string is the key and the value stores the string's length and parity.

Question 3: Safe Function Application
This program calculates powers from a list of base and exponent pairs, skips negative exponents, and stores the result in a list.

Question 4: Sorted Search with Conditions
The program generates and sorts a list of random numbers between 0 and1, store all values greater than or equal to a given random number, and finds the first index where this occurs.

Question 5: Circle Area Comparison with Validation
This program takes user input for two radii, checks if they're valid. It then calculates the area and finds how much of the larger circle can be covered by the smaller one.

Question 6:Distribution Analysis
This program goes through a list of numbers, counts how many times each number appears, and calculates the percentage of values that are less than or equal to each number. The results are then stored in a dictionary.

Question 7: Time Conversion Function
This program converts seconds to a standard 12-hour clock format, displaying hours, minutes, seconds, and AM or PM.

Question 8: Pandas DataFrame with Computed Column
